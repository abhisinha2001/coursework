Example code for this lab has been tested on both the Raspberry Pi Pico hardware platform as well as the Woki online simulator for the Raspberry Pi Pico. There are some differences between using the Wokwi online simulator and the real Raspberry Pi Pico hardware however.

The {\ttfamily wokwi-\/pi-\/pico} component environment option in the {\ttfamily diagram.\+json} file may also need to be set to use {\ttfamily arduino-\/community} for the code to work correctly (proably a quirk of the simulator).

To run the demo on the simulator, rename the default {\ttfamily sketch.\+ino} file to be called {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{lab03_8c}{lab03.\+c}}} and overwrite the default content with the content of the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{lab03_8c}{lab03.\+c}}} file in this repository. Create a new file and call it {\ttfamily lab03.\+S} (capital S in the extension is important) for the assembly code. Finally, make sure to update the {\ttfamily diagram.\+json} if required (but do not change the name).
