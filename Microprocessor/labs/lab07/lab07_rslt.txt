Performance improvement with Caching:

The ratio between time taken without caching to time taken with caching will give us ratio of improvement.

For example: 1152926473884008448/31996716081217536 = 36.0326500681, which implies that the process improves by 36 times with caching. 
The percentage improvement is caclulated by taking the the (Old time-New time)/Old Time *100

Total Sequential Runtime improvement: +97.22 % or 36x Performance improvement.

Total Parallel Runtime improvement: 0.006106 % or 1.000061x Performance improvement.

Caching in multicore increases the execution time drastically. The execution times are displayed using the %lld type specifier.

In cases where multicore is used, the application benefits from Caching. Total Single core runtime is also improved by Caching. 
Hence, caching is an extremely effective way of improving Performance on a system.
